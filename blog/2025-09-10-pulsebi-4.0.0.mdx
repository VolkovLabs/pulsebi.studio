## Streamlined Alerts Management

Managing alerts across multiple environments has never been easier. With PulseBI Studio, you can now copy alerts to another engine with just a few clicks. This feature simplifies configuration management, saves time, and ensures consistency across your systems, whether you're scaling operations or testing in different environments.

## Enhanced Alert Evaluations

Precision is key when it comes to alerts. We’ve added visibility to selected field thresholds and threshold units, empowering you to customize alerts with greater accuracy. This update ensures that your alerts are tailored to your specific needs, reducing noise and focusing on what truly matters.

## Improved Report Details Visibility

Reporting issues can slow down critical workflows. Studio now displays failed reports in your history, giving you clear insights into what went wrong. This transparency allows for quicker resolution, ensuring your reporting processes remain reliable and efficient.

## Contextual Actions Enhancements

Understanding the relationships between alerts, reports, and actions is crucial for effective decision-making. This release introduces the ability to view alerts and reports linked to specific actions, providing valuable context and enabling you to track dependencies with ease.

## AI-Powered Interactivity with MCP Server Integration

Unlock the power of AI with our new MCP server integration. PulseBI Engine leverages AI-driven insights to enhance data processing, offering smarter recommendations and automation. This feature helps you uncover hidden patterns and make data-driven decisions faster than ever before.

## Seamless Auto Updates from the Home Screen

Keeping your platform up-to-date should be effortless. We’ve moved the Auto Update logic to the Home screen, making it more accessible and intuitive. Stay current with the latest features and security patches without navigating through complex menus.

## Simplified Organization Management

Administrators can now view pending users directly in Organization settings. This update streamlines user management, ensuring that onboarding and access control are handled efficiently, even in large teams or complex organizational structures.

## Secure Renderer Microservice with JWT Authentication

Security is a top priority. PulseBI Engine introduces JWT authentication for the renderer microservice, adding an extra layer of protection to your data rendering workflows. This ensures that sensitive information remains secure while maintaining seamless performance.

## Cleaner Architecture with Removed Feature Flags

To simplify compatibility and maintain a robust system, we’ve removed Feature Flags in this release. This change results in a cleaner, more maintainable architecture, paving the way for future innovations and smoother updates.

## Performance Boost Through Refactoring

Speed and responsiveness are at the heart of PulseBI. We’ve refactored key modules and optimized the engine for faster processing. These behind-the-scenes improvements translate to a more fluid user experience, even when handling large datasets or complex workflows.

## Robust Security Enhancements

Protecting your data is non-negotiable. This release strengthens interactions with security fields, offering advanced safeguards for sensitive information. With the latest release, you can trust that your operations are secure without sacrificing usability.
